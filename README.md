# Digital Library Management System API

## Business Context

### Overview

The Digital Library Management System is a modern backend API solution designed to digitize and streamline library
operations for public and institutional libraries. As libraries transition from manual record-keeping to digital
platforms, this system provides a comprehensive solution for managing book catalogs, user memberships, and borrowing
workflows.

### Business Problem

Traditional libraries face several operational challenges:

- Manual tracking of book availability and reservations leads to errors and inefficiency
- Limited visibility into borrowing patterns and inventory usage
- Poor user experience with no self-service capabilities for browsing or reserving books
- Difficulty managing overdue books and calculating late fees
- Time-consuming checkout and return processes at the library desk

### Solution

Our Digital Library Management System provides:

- **Self-service portal** for users to browse, search, and reserve books online
- **Automated reservation management** with 7-day pickup windows
- **Real-time availability tracking** to reduce operational overhead
- **Librarian tools** for efficient checkout and return processing
- **Borrowing history** for patrons to track their reading activity
- **Scalable architecture** ready for cloud deployment

### Target Users

1. **Library Patrons**: Browse catalog, reserve books, view borrowing history
2. **Librarians**: Process checkouts and returns, manage reservations
